# SaveFileTransfer
 Transfer some save files to a certain location with one click  totally personal small project  The reason I make this is because I'm getting tired of those game with no save option on hardcore mode and SL cost my time to manually copy and paste those save files. Sometimes manage those savefiles' orders also made me mad.
